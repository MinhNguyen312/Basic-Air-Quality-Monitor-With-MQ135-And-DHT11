# Basic-Air-Quality-Monitor-With-MQ135-And-DHT11
A basic Internet of Things (IoT) project that uses ESP8266, MQ135 Air Quality Sensor, and temperature and humidity sensor DHT11 to process and evaluate air quality based on CO2 parts per million (PPM). Those value will be send to Firebase Real-time Database and Blynk IoT software platform to be monitored.
